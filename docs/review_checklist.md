    3. What noise will be generated by connected devices? (e.g. mains adaptors)
    4. What countries will the product be sold in? What standards cover these countries?
    5. What is the end use for the product? Does this have any specific EMC requirements ?
       1. Industrial or automotive use has different test requirements and permissable emission levels than consumer goods. For industrial, the levels are usually higher. See [Conformance UK's guide](https://www.conformance.co.uk/adirectives/doku.php?id=emc#tests)

14. Prevention

    1. What should have ESD protection? #ESD
    2. Do switching supplies have (or have an option for) RC snubbers?
       1. While not always needed for stability, an RC snubber can dampen ringing oscillations, which result in high frequency noise that may exceed EMC limits.
    3. Is differential signalling used for digital signals where possible?
       1. Differential signals are not only more immune to noise, but emit less as well. For high speed, long signal lines (e.g. remote displays in automotive), the difference can be considerable.
    4. Is differential signalling used for analog signals?
    5. Are shielded connectors needed?
    6. Is a shielded case needed? How will this be bonded to ground?
    7. Are switched-mode power supplies synchronized?
       1. If switch mode power supplies are powered from the same source and are not syncronized, they can produce "beat" frequencies from being out of phase, and input and output ripple is also increased. See [TI Power Tip 73: Synchronizing Makes for Well-Behaved Power Supplies](https://www.eetimes.com/author.asp?section_id=183&doc_id=1323282)

3. Has procurement avaialbility and longevity been assessed?

   1. Are any components expected for obsoletion or NRND?
      1. Any components which are or expected to be obsolete or NRND (Not Recommended for New Designs) should be clearly flagged in documentation.

2. Can components be oriented in roughly the same way / consistency in layout?

3. Are components easily accessible?

   1. For inspection?
   2. For replacement?
   3. Large components or high density boards might make it difficult to inspect components during testing or after failure. Apart from visual blocking it can also manifest as physically blocking from accessing with probes.

4. Are interactive components placed in a logical manner? (Consistent orientation of buttons? Consistent rotation of potentiometers?)

5. Are temperature sensitive components placed away from hot components?

6. Should there be a ground ring?

   1. Ground rings\_ serve both a signal integrity and a practical purpose. For EMC it is necessary to avoid traces along edges of the PCB. Adding a ground ring is an easy way of ensuring this constraint is held. It also provides somewhat better EMI prevention.

2. Symbols

   1. Are explicit and informative

   5. Reflect the functionality or logical structure of the component
      1. In contrast to placing pins as the physically appear on the device. Schematics should reflect functionality; board layout should reflect physical reality. Physical pin layout has its merit in making debugging easier -- however, so does having a clearer schematic.

   2. JTAG
      1. Have datasheets been consulted for necessary pull-up/-down?
         1. Typically TMS and TDI are pull-up and TCK is pull-down, but it changes between manufacturers and devices.

   3. SWD
      1. Have datasheets been consulted for necessary pull-up/-down?
         1. Typically TMS and TDI are pull-up and TCK is pull-down, but it changes between manufacturers and devices.

   7. Are ferrite beads on input/output power lines?
   8. Are ferrite beads on sensitive signal lines?
      1. This includes signal lines that are not sensitive themselves, but connect to sensitive components. E.g. U-Blox recommend ferrite beads on GPS module UART connections to avoid RF noise travelling "along" and into the module, see [U-Blox M8 Hardware Integration Manual](https://www.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/NEO-M8_HardwareIntegrationManual_%28UBX-13003557%29.pdf)
   9. Do all ferrite beads have sufficient margin in DC current rating?
      1. When the DC current (DC bias current) approaches the maximum, the effective impedance of ferrite beads decreases significantly.
      2. See [Analog Devices AN-1368, Choosing and Using Ferrite Beads](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/application-notes/an-1368.pdf)
   10. Is there an estimate of what frequencies the ferrite beads are required to filter?
   11. Do high-speed single-ended digital signals have series resistors?
   12. Is there a footprint for a common mode filter on high-speed differential signals going offboard?
       1. For high-speed differential buses like USB 3.0, DisplayPort, and HDMI, a common-mode filter will stop common-mode noise generated in the transceiver from traveling into the signal line where it may radiate from the cable.
       2. Notice that the filter might degrade the differential signal slightly.
       3. Using a footprint allows one to be quickly fitted in case EMC testing fails.
   13. Do op-amps have input filters for EMI?
       1. High frequency EMI signals can be rectified by the op-amp if not filtered out beforehand, resulting in DC errors at the output.
       2. See [Analog Devices MT-096, RFI Rectification Concepts](https://www.analog.com/media/en/training-seminars/tutorials/MT-096.pdf) and [Analogue circuit design for RF immunity, Clough Consoltants](https://cherryclough.com/media/file/Miscellaneous/Analogue%20circuit%20design%20for%20RF%20immunity,%20EMCJ,%20Issue%2084,%20Sept%202009.pdf)
   14. Do any signal lines require pseudo-differential treatment due to noise?
   15. Are voltage dividers re-calculated for exact signal thresholds?
   16. Is there a Zener or C on op-amp outputs to prevent overvoltage?
   17. Are optoisolators protected with parallel RC or diode for noise immunity?
   18. Are transient voltage suppression (TVS) diodes added to all external interfaces and connectors for ESD protection?
