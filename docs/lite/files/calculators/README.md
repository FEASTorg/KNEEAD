# Calculators

This directory contains a collection of interactive calculator tools implemented as Jupyter notebooks. These calculators are intended to support rapid engineering analysis and design decisions for electrical and electronic systems. Each calculator focuses on a specific topic, from unit conversions to component selection and circuit behavior.

## References

The [DigiKey Conversion Calculators](https://www.digikey.ca/en/resources/online-conversion-calculators) served as a core reference and inspiration for the structure and coverage of this collection. The goal was to create open, locally runnable versions of the most useful engineering calculators for education and design support.

If you're a DigiKey team member and have concerns about any of the material here, _please feel free to reach out_ â€” this project is intended to complement and build on publicly available knowledge, not compete with it.

Additionally, the [IPC-2221: Generic Standard on Printed Board Design](https://www-eng.lbl.gov/~shuman/NEXT/CURRENT_DESIGN/TP/MATERIALS/IPC_2221.pdf) was consulted, as it is widely cited by DigiKey and others as a foundational guideline for PCB design best practices.
